#  Number Guessing Game (Java)

A simple console-based Number Guessing Game built in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.


##  Features

- Generates a random number between 1 to 100
- User guesses the number with hints ("Too high" / "Too low")
- Limited number of attempts (default: 7)
- Score tracking based on rounds won
- Option to play multiple rounds
- Input validation for incorrect entries


##  How It Works

1. The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user has up to 7 chances to guess the number correctly.
3. After each guess, the program informs whether the guess is:
   - Too high
   - Too low
   - Correct
4. If guessed correctly within attempts, the user wins the round.
5. After each round, the user is prompted to play again.
6. At the end, the total rounds and rounds won are displayed.
